# Looper
Play in musical scales and record simple loops.


I was inspired by <a href="https://femurdesign.com/omni/">OMNI by Femur</a> and became captivated by scales.

“Scale” comes from a Latin word which means ladder. A scale is the tonal basis of music. It is a set of tones from which you can build melodies and harmonies. The tones of a scale are ordered according to their pitch. Since scales create various distinctive moods, atmospheres and tonal flavours, there are as many scales as there are cultures around the world.

Play the keys with mouse or touch or even plug a MIDI keyboard in. Record simple loops and have fun exploring the unique sounds of different cultures patterns!
